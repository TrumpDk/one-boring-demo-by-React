This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This project is generated by React, Ant Design, axios, React-router-dom, Redux.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Other technique
In order to load antd-mobile components on demand.You have to add a babel plugin.

### How to install it
run such command `npm install babel-plugin-import --save-dev`
and add such configuration in you .babelrc file 
`{`
    `"plugins": [`
      `["import", { "libraryName": "antd-mobile", "style": "css" }]`
    `]`
`}`
For more details please view: https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import
And at this step,we have last one thing to do.You have to create a file named `config-overrides.js`.And then configure it like this
`const { override, fixBabelImports } = require('customize-cra');`
`module.exports = override(`
    `fixBabelImports('import', {`
        `libraryName: 'antd-mobile',`
        `style: 'css',`
    `}),`
`);`.
